# Background

​​MacKay et al. proposed a cooperation strategy such that (a) all countries agree to a global carbon price by voting, and (b) rich countries transfer funds to the poor countries through a central enforcement agency. While (a) is targeted towards achieving climate targets to reduce carbon emissions, (b) ensures that we achieve (a) without widening inequities between various countries. Note that (b) also makes the cooperation required in (a) feasible.

Thus, we ask whether this policy will result in cooperation among the countries. If so, what will be the agreed global carbon price? How much amount will the rich countries need to transfer to the poor countries? What shocks in the system (e.g., catastrophic environmental disaster) will lead to cooperation or lack thereof?

To do this, we propose to build a multi-agent RL environment that captures how each country’s as well as global financial & environmental variables advance in each time step. As the author points out, their proposed strategy does not require interactions between the countries (e.g., trade agreements) as all contracts are signed through a central enforcement body. In addition, countries can use a myriad of policies to maintain their average carbon price to the global carbon price.
